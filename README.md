# Ello Render Pipeline

This gem provides a convenient API to a customized [html-pipeline](https://github.com/jch/html-pipeline/) stack that we use for rendering posts and profiles on Ello.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ello/render_pipeline.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ello/render_pipeline)

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'render_pipeline', github: 'ello/render_pipeline'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle


## Usage

```ruby
RenderPipeline.render('textual content')
```

The pipeline supports a few more advanced options, including the ability to configure multiple preset "contexts" with different rendering options. For now, see the tests for more information on how to set those up.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `rake` to run the tests. 

You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
